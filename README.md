## The Golden Rule:

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

1. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
1. Validate each line of code before moving forward
1. Keep it Simple Simon (KISS)

## Making a plan

1. Make a drawing of your app. **Simple "wireframes"**
1. Once you have a drawing, **name the HTML elements** you'll need to realize your vision**
1. Determine the Components (sections) of your app.
1. Within each component:
    - For each HTML element ask: **Why do I need this?**
    - Does this element need **static content**, or is the content **dynamic state**?
    - If dynamic, what is **state** and what is it called
    - **Find all the 'events'** (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. 
1. For events, ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?
1. Once we know the _why_ of elements, state, and events -- think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
1. Think about how to **validate each of your features** according to a Definition of Done
1. Consider what features **_depend_ on what other features**. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.
